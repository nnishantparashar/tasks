//2.Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript

Objects are important data types in javascript. Objects are different than primitive datatypes (i.e. number, 
string, boolean, etc.). Primitive data types contain one value but Objects can hold many values in form of 
Key: value pair. These keys can be variables or functions and are called properties and methods, respectively, 
in the context of an object.

"objects in JavaScript may be defined as an unordered collection of related data, of primitive or reference 
types, in the form of “key: value” pairs."

An object can be created in many ways:
One of easiest way to create a javascript object is object literal, simply define the property and values inside
 curly braces as shown below-
let bike = {name: 'SuperSport', maker:'Ducati', engine:'937cc'};

JavaScript Object with Constructor function and with help of new keyword, constructor function allows to create 
multiple objects of same flavor 
as shown below:
function Vehicle(name, maker) {
   this.name = name;
   this.maker = maker;
}
let car1 = new Vehicle(’Fiesta’, 'Ford’);
let car2 = new Vehicle(’Santa Fe’, 'Hyundai’)

JavaScript Object with Keyword new:

var person = new Object();
person.firstName = “John”;
person.lastName = “Doe”;
person.age = 50;
person.eyeColor = “blue”;

Objects can also be created using the Object.create() method:

// Animal properties
var Animal = {
  type: 'Invertebrates', 
  }


// Create new animal type called Fishes
var fish = Object.create(Animal);
fish.type = 'Fishes';
