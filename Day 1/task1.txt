//1.Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2

HTTP/1.1: When we make a request to the server for on any webpage & server responds to you as a resource html 
page. For sending the request and the response there is a TCP connection established between client & server. 
Again you make a request to the server for other resources like- image img.jpg & the server gives a response 
as an image img.jpg. The connection was not lost here after the first request because it adds a keep-alive 
header which is the part of the request so there is an open connection between the server & client. There are 
several requests & responses, which are merged in a single connection. These are the drawbacks of HTTP/1.1: The 
first problem is HTTP/1.1 transfer all the requests & responses in the plain text message form. The second one 
is head of line blocking in which TCP connection is blocked all other requests until the response does not 
receive. All the information related to the header file is repeated in every request(information overhead).

HTTP/2: HTTP/2 was developed over the SPDY protocol. HTTP/2 works on the binary framing layer instead of textual 
that converts all the messages in binary format. It works on fully multiplexed that is one TCP connection is used 
for multiple requests. HTTP/2 uses HPACK which is used to split data from header. It compresses the header. 
The server sends all the other files like CSS & JS without the request of the client using the PUSH frame.
